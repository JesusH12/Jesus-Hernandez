                <p style="color:blue;"> Hello! My name is Jesus Hernandez Zafra, <br> 
                    and I'm a freshman at NJIT. I am from New Brunswick; <br> 
                    New Jersey and I've lived there for all my life. <br>
                    I am a 1st-gen and come from a Hispanic household with <br>
                    both my parents coming from Mexico. With that, I am <br>
                    bilingual and can speak both English and Spanish. <br>
                    I also have two older siblings who have graduated from <br>
                    college and have guided me throughout my life.</p>
