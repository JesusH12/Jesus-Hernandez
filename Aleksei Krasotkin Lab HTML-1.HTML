My name is Aleksei Krasotkin. I come from a big country called Russia. <br>
I lived in the city of Tula, few people know what kind of city it is, <br>
and when we met, I simply answered that I had come from Moscow. <br>
Because it is quite difficult to explain to the same person what kind <br>
of city and in what part it is located. I studied at a music school until <br>
the 7th grade, where the education was better than in ordinary schools <br>
because we were given a lot of time due to the small number of people. <br>
But the English language is still not at such a good level, we studied it, <br>
but not with publicity for the future. It all started in the 7th grade,<br>
I arrived in the middle of the school year, and this time was very difficult <br>
because I did not know the language at all from the word at all, it was very <br>
difficult. I got into the ESL class then, I thought it would help, but in the end, <br>
the class did not really help. I had to study everything myself. A year and a <br>
half, with great difficulty, when I was in the 9th grade and then I thought <br>
about what I want to do in life. “There are many such professions that are useful <br>
for others,”  I said to myself, but here is what to do so that I, too, would be <br>
interested, that is the question. I thought I thought. So, unfortunately, that day <br>
did not lead to anything. In the end, I put this idea aside and did not think about <br>
it for a long time. When I was randomly assigned an Architecture class, I thought <br>
it would be the most boring class I ever took in school, but no. I was so carried <br>
away by this that I graduated with honors and went to an architecture camp for <br>
the summer. After that, the following year, I also took architecture classes,<br>
and I liked them so much that I decided to take an architecture class the next <br>
year and classes related to the creation of objects. And the time flew by quickly, <br>
and then I returned to this issue, and without thinking about it for a long time I <br>
decided that I would be engaged in architecture and go in this direction. <br>
Well, I ended up here at NJIT in the architecture department.
